# CP2K CDFT development branch 
This repository contains the constrained density functional theory (CDFT) development branch for [**CP2K**](https://www.cp2k.org/ "CP2K Project"). CP2K is a freely available quantum chemistry package to perform atomistic simulations of solid state, liquid, molecular, periodic, material, crystal, and biological systems. 

The theoretical basis, features, and usage of the CDFT/CP2K implementation will in the future be documented at the [Wiki](https://github.com/nholmber/cp2k-cdft-dev/wiki). In the meanwhile, please refer to the publication: 

Holmberg, Nico; Laasonen, Kari, *Efficient Constrained Density Functional Theory Implementation for Simulation of Condensed Phase Electron Transfer Reactions*, J. Chem. Theory Comput., Article ASAP (2016), doi: [10.1021/acs.jctc.6b01085](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b01085 "Online Version of Publication").


## Available branches

1. `main`: latest stable build
	* ideally a synced clone of the official cp2k [`trunk`](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k) branch with finalized CDFT features pushed upstream 
	* currently based on cp2k version `r17702`, patch submitted upstream but **NOT** yet available from the [official SVN mirror](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cp2k/?source=navbar)  

2. `development`: unstable development branch
	* might not compile, incomplete implementation of new features, code not cleaned 
	* features under development:
		- combined charge + spin constraints
		- allow the user to choose between serial and parallel mode of calculating mixed CDFT state  
		- refactoring of Becke constraint type under CDFT control type  

3. `legacy`: deprecated stable build
	* old stable build based on cp2k version `r15682` with some backport buxfixes from newer versions
	* **NOT** available from the [official SVN mirror](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cp2k/?source=navbar) 
	* will be removed in the future


## Installation

1. Latest stable version (from official repos)
	* Download the trunk version (use either `svn` or `git`)
		- `svn checkout http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cp2k/code/trunk dir_name`
		- `git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k master`
	* Follow the installation instructions in the file [`INSTALL`](cp2k/INSTALL), also available at the official [CP2K project page](https://www.cp2k.org/howto:compile) 

2. Other versions
	* Clone the latest stable build in a directory of your choice  
	  `git clone -b branch_name --single-branch https://github.com/nholmber/cp2k-cdft-dev branch_name`
	* Continue as above

## Running a CDFT calculation

An official tutorial is in preparation and will be added to the [Wiki](https://github.com/nholmber/cp2k-cdft-dev/wiki). A minimal how-to guide can be found in the regtests `regtest-cdft-*`, which can be found in the folder [`cp2k/tests/QS/`](cp2k/tests/QS/). A `HTML` keyword manual is available [online](https://manual.cp2k.org/trunk/index.html). A local copy of the keyword manual can be generated by following these [instructions](https://www.cp2k.org/howto:generate_manual). 

## Bugs, ideas and contributing

The implemented CDFT features in the `main` branch have been tested, but some unforseen bugs might still be present. If you encounter problems please open a new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nholmber/cp2k-cdft-dev/issues) and include a minimal input file for reproducing the bug. New development ideas and contributions are also welcomed.
