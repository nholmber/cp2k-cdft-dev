# improved initial guess can be obtained with

# and iterate till convergence with

# you may force the start of a new amoeba cycle with
touch NEXT
# before 400 iterations are completed. Values in the range 400 to 800 are appropriate for the
# -n option. The actual value for the -c option does not matter that much, since a pseudo.x run
# can always be stopped softly with
touch EXIT

# the fit

gnuplot pswf.gnu
